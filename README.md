# RealmSwiftFHIR
RealmSwiftFHIR is an adaptation of [smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/Swift-FHIR/), but which supports Realm. All FHIR `Resources` and `Elements` can be persisted to a Realm database via normal Realm means. Checkout the original Swift-FHIR project for more details.

The classes were generated from a forked verision of [smart-on-fhir/fhir-parser](https://github.com/smart-on-fhir/fhir-parser), which can be found at [ryanbaldwin/fhir-parser](https://github.com/ryanbaldwin/fhir-parser) (see the `realm-spike` branch). My current intention is to clean up this spike and submit a PR back to the original project.

### State of the Union
RealmSwiftFHIR is brand new and should be considered a Work In Progress. While initial testing appears to be working, and all unit tests pass, I've yet to actually use it in anything substantial. Use this at your own risk, and let me know if there are any 

### Versioning
The current, and only version, of `RealmSmartFHIR` uses the [FHIR DSTU2 spec](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/DSTU2/).

### Using RealmSwiftFHIR
This project currently supports Carthage, and I'll likely never support Cocoa-Pods because Cocoa-Pods, well, honestly, I hate Cocoa-Pods. 

0. [Install Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage), if you haven't already.
1. Add `github "ryanbaldwin/RealmSwiftFHIR" == 0.1` to your `Cartfile`
2. Do a quick `carthage update` and add the [framework to your project](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application) as you normally would.
3. Build a kick ass application
4. Buy [Pascal Pfiffner](https://github.com/p2) a beer, because none of this is possible without his amazing work
